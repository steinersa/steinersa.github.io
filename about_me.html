				<h1> Hi, I'm Sarah! </h1>
				<p> I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, earning a Bachelors of Science in Psychology with an emphasis in Human Services and a minor in Biology. While pursuing my degree, I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge gained in the classroom to real-world environments. This experience was gained at the Boys & Girls Club of Greater Dubuque as a social and educational program intern, and at the YMCA of Greater Waukesha County as a senior day camp counselor. Working with children has always been a very rewarding experience, which led me to volunteer at places, such as Discovery World and Platteville Middle School. </p>
				<p> After being introduced to a different way of caring for individuals, once graduated, I began working as a customer service specialist, and later, an administrative assistant for Wisconsin Memorial Park Cemetery. I am currently enrolled in devCodeCamp to gain experience in software development to further my career opportunities. I'm excited to be taking the next step in developing my skill set, and I'm looking forward to what the future holds! </p>
